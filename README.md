William's Dotfiles
==================

What
----
I work on a lot of different systems, so it'd be to throw all my configs in one
folder and take them with me. This repo is an attempt to do that.

All files are stored without the dot, which is added by the script. This just
makes the bash scripting easier. This file, the script itself, and any actually
hidden folders will be ignored.

Configs So Far
--------------
 - None

If you've found this repo and are fairly sure you shouldn't have, send an email
to wosler [at] acm [dot] org so I can fix that.
